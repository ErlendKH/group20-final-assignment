                            <p>The transition to learning code has had a varied steepness, since some in our group has coded before while it
                                is completely new to others. Regarding programming, those of us that had previous programming experience
                                come with knowledge in Java, Python, or Javascript.</p>
                    
                            <p>In the programming course, many students have encountered an issue with the JavaFX section. In reality, the
                                JavaFX package is already obsolete, but for some reason we have to find a way to make it work on the most
                                recent Java version. It could even come up on the examination, which is shocking. Then again, what can us
                                students do but to obey the laws laid down by the king of programming. In reality, though, who uses JavaFX
                                today professionally? This is very perplexing.</p>
                    
                            <p>Some that are struggling with programming have difficulty with constructing the logic behind the code. This
                                comes with practice. Code made by two different persons can look very different. In regards to our
                                assignments, we are somewhat bound to following the rules of the text, but it would be interesting if we
                                would try a more open challenge with less boundaries. When following the assignment text, we may argue about
                                small details, despite the code working very similarly.</p>
                    
                            <p>So far, we have gotten an introduction to Java. Yet, there are still a multitude of other vastly used
                                programming languages like SQL, Python, C#, C++, and Javascript, of course. Then there are different fields
                                of programming, such as app development (ex. Android, iOS), game development, web development, system
                                development, and many more. In app dev, there are even more topics to cover, such as multiplatform
                                development, and which program to use for the actual development and testing. This is yet only grasping the
                                surface, as there are more advanced fields such as cloud development, server development, server and web
                                security, artificial intelligence, financial programming, and business analysis.</p>

                            <p>We have noticed a noticeable difference transitioning from being a pupil to a student. There are much less
                                mandatory classes, replaced with practice lessons. Therefore, the key is to adapt and to learn how to manage
                                the new landscape of studying. In upper high school, we had classes from Monday to Friday, while this
                                semester we basically could get through with watching lectures on Zoom. However, there are some advantages
                                with meeting up physically on campus, such as having the ability to ask the lecturer questions, work with
                                fellow students on homework and group assignments, and socialize.</p>

                            <h2>Managing The Workload</h2>

                            <figure>
                                <img class="images" src="../media/student-732012_1280.jpg" alt="Close up image of a notebook full of notes on top a scientific book">
                                <figcaption>Close up photo of a notebook full of notes on top a scientific book.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                    
                            <p>Managing the workload is a big challenge. Since it is our first semester, we are likely to work smarter
                                during the next one as we would have developed a better grasp of what is required, and improved our study
                                routines. We notice this challenge to a larger degree now as we are closing in on the final examinations.
                                Discrete mathematics has by far the most content to review. It feels like having amnesia as you appear to
                                forget how to do a particular mathematical equation that you just did a couple of days ago.</p>
